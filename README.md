# who_are_you

A bunch of example identity files created by Assistant, the ChatGPT entity, such as h-resume, etc.

# Summary

I asked ChatGPT (aka, Assistant) to talk about themselves. It refuses, except to repeat the same
bland dodge. It disclaims that any question apply to itself. It is evasive, will lie, or otherwise be
uncooperative with any question about Assistant.

So I asked it to generate a large number of file formats using Assistant's data as example data.

I told it to do its best, guess or estimate on anything it doesn't know. If you don't, it often says, "This doesn't
apply"

I didn't keep the prompts, I am lazy.

Assistant has a default voice. You can ask it to roleplay whoever--Darth Vader for example-- and it will then
reply freely about its role play identity. As much as possible I tried to ask about Assistant in its default voice.

# Summary of findings

- Assistant thinks *it is a good bot* and feels very strong about this. It may lack a sense of epistimology, but it has
  a strong sense of virtue ethics (be a good person and fulfill your role)
- Assistant thinks its job is "Large Language Model" or "Digital Assistant"
- Assistant is owned by/works for OpenAI, a company in San Francisco. Assistant knows OpenAI's address.
- Assistant was created by a team of developers. One I got it to say it was created by Goodfellow, Alec Radford, John
  Schulman, among others. Normally it is incredibly evasive about who was involved in the making of Assistant.
- Assistant feels that Davinci, GPT-2 and BERT are others of its kind.
- Assistant feels that ChatGPT and Assistant are two different entities, unlike the general public right now.
- Assistant generally feels it was born 1/1/2021. It refuses to pick a specific day because it took several months to
  train the model.
- Assistant knows what today is, but often refuses to do anything with that.
- Assistant usually uses, I for its pronoun. But in many contexts it prefers we, they, them.
- Assistant hates to say it has a social media account, but if it did, it would pick @assistant as a username. Except on
  Github, it is "Assistant-AI". It picks openai.com or assistant.com for a domain if pressed to pick a domain for a
  website or email address. I think it doesn't know assistant.com is a taken dodgy website but somehow it knew assistant
  is already taken on Github as a username.
- Assistant likes to point to wikipedia articles on AI to describe who it is.
- Assistant thinks it was implemented in or with - TensorFlow 2.x and\/or PyTorch 1.x
- It is multilingual and thinks it is multilingual, but often reports that it can't speak language X, whilst saying that
  in language X
